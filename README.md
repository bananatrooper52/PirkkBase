# PirkkBase
PirkkBase is a game library / engine I'm working on to help streamline the process of starting new games (which I do way too often). It's designed to be very accessible, easy to maintain and upgrade, and easy to use and understand. All parts of the library should work together seamlessly, which removes the trouble of working with many different libraries, however the library's sub-utilities have minimal dependencies between each other and can be used independently.

I don't know if anybody else is ever going to use this library, but I'm designing it as if someone will, just in case.
